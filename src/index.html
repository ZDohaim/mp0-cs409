          <p>Undergraduate Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Business at the 
            <italic>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.</italic> I am currently a senior, and love to build things, from legos to PCBs, having an idea
            and turning it into an actual thing is something that really excited me.

            I previously worked at a startup called Penny Software back home in Saudi Arabia, as a Software Engineering Intern, where I learned to work with Angular
            and improved my development skills, however I was a bit too reliant on AI, which is why I wanted to take this course, to learn the basics really well and to truly understand web development. </p>
